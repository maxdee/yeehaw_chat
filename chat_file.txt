I have a question for Wild Bill!
/chat grace_blush1968
Dear Wild Bill. In Japan we have koi fish. They are very beautiful and usually live about 30 years. The oldest koi fish was named Hanako and lived close to my city. Hanako the koi fish died at 226 years old.
My question for you Wild Bill-San, How old are you? How long will it be before you die? Love from your adoring fan, Grace.

According to google, the average life span of a pet goldfish is five to 10 years. In the wild, they can live as long as 25 years. In fact, the oldest goldfish ever recorded was 43 years old. But prolonging the life of your fish depends on proper care and tank environment.
